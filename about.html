   <p>Greetings! I'm Nathan, also known as xTekker in online communities. I'm a 28-year-old self-taught programmer based in the UK. Ever since I can remember, computers have captivated my imagination, and for the past 7 years, I've been on an exciting coding adventure.</p>
   <p>Building this website from scratch has been one of my proudest accomplishments. Every line of code and every pixel on the screen reflects my passion and dedication to creating something truly unique. From designing the user interface to implementing complex functionalities, I've poured my heart and soul into this project.</p>
   <p>Along the way, I've embraced challenges, conquered obstacles, and pushed the boundaries of what I thought was possible. The journey of self-teaching has not only equipped me with technical expertise but also fostered a deep sense of perseverance, problem-solving, and continuous learning.</p>
   <p>In addition to my coding endeavors, I actively engage in open-source projects and thrive in collaborative developer communities such as Github and StackOverflow. Sharing my knowledge and learning from others has been instrumental in my growth as a programmer.</p>
   <p>When I'm not immersed in code, you can find me avidly exploring the latest advancements in the tech industry. Gaming and tinkering with hardware are among my favorite pastimes, allowing me to indulge in my passion from different angles.</p>
    <p>This website is one of the ways I can do that, allowing me to seemlessly deploy projects from my Github straight to my online webspace to test new syntax changes or entire new languages.</p>
